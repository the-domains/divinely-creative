> If you fall into prove mode, you're selling yourself short. Less proving, more giving.

> When you work towards proving your worth, you're investing in the illusion that you are not worthy. 

Tangible example would be trying to make your work the coolest of all to prove you're the best. You deeply claim it is not so.

What kind of reward are you expecting? How does demanding for attention feels to you? It drains. Each time you are doing anything for the attention, or some fulfillment in the future, you're keeping yourself far from that reach and see yourself as separate from it all.

Look at this.

What if you'd realise you are worthy already? Of course you develop better and better skills, we all do. It would make no sense if we wouldn't. But what if you'd accept yourself right now and create for the sake of giving? Giving inspiration, sharing knowledge, sharing Your attention, rather than asking for one. What if every day you'd claim yourself as whole and full of creative potential that's dying to go out, be expressed and fulfilled? Not thinking about the outcome you're gonna get. What if you'd ask yourself: how and what could I give today?

By giving you get. It's universal truth and it is understood only by practice. Try.

Be only careful for giving honestly. Stay honest, with ease. Otherwise you'll overgive and will be closed to receive. Allow it to be balanced.

You have to wait for recognition, support, fulfillment NO MORE. Noones opinion could shake your ground. Only improve. Notice. Grow. Together.

Here comes freedom you were searching for, and yet didn't know you so deeply want it. Unhook.
