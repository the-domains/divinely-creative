## [YOU CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY, PRODUCTIVE, CREATIVE and whatever you WISH to BE. It's only a Choice. ][0]

Dreaming of a better life is a good thing when it's based on a vision rather than a simple sense of a lack. There is a saying: 'whatever you appreciate, appreciates you'. It does not mean, however, that you need to pour pink paint over your circumstances, as a great speaker, writer, Marianne Williamson, reminds us so often. It would not help us move beyond it. 

When we clutter our lifes with tremendous amount of past failures, hurts, continuous lack of energy and the need to hustle just so we could compensate our lack of achievement, money or anything that comes to your mind...but we so often don't take resposibility for Now. Yes, we can bash ourselfs for making mistakes and get stuck in them. It's important to know where we got wrong. But in order to move forward, we need to forgive and choose again. 
> 
> All we need for our success is to acknowledge what is not working and allow for what is working to step in.

So next time you're feeling overwhelmed, stuck and unable to find creative solution for your project or see the other way for any situation you're faced with, ask yourself: what am I not seing here? what am I not giving? who am I not forgiving? Where I am stuck in the past, where I am stuck in the future? And choose again. 

Choose to be productive. Choose to hustle with ease, with conviction and purpose. Choose to feel alive by changing your habits. Choose mindful hustle. 

Want to know how to change your habits with ease? [Here you go. ][1]

Stay Inspired. Stay Creative.
