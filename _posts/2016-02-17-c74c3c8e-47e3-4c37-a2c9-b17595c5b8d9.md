I wanted to say a warm welcome to you for giving your precious time to read this, listen to the Divinely Creative podcast or even just for a quick glance to all this creative world. 

I am Karolina, director and 3D artist at [Catalysee][0]. Through many many years of testing various mind tricks and changing habits, I had to go through deep burnout to finally find the best ones. Those, which keep you alive, charged, happy and extremely productive at the same time.

> You can establish habits and mindset to have limitless creative energy kick daily. Trust it.

And I am here to save you loads of time, energy and stop you from creative burnout. Or, hopefully, help you get out if it, if it already clicked. You are not alone and the time to boost your energy in long-lasting way has come. 

If you're interested in watery design itself, I have good news for you too! Right now I'm creating [LearnWateryDesign][1] course, which will be way more than just technical revealation how to do things. More so, it's being created to built the right mindset for successful creative process, save time, energy and express the best ideas, while making space for them to come to you. 

This is going to be a huge year for all of us. And I'm doing my best to share it in the best possible way. 

Stay Inspired. Stay Creative. 

With love, Karolina
