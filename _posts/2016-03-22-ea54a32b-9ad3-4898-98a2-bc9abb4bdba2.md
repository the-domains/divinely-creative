* * I see a lot of creative foaks bumping into the familiar struggles that I've been bumping my head off for years. You know those moments, when you overwork, have lack of sleep and make wrong choices because of it. **The project you took so quickly appeared to be the opposite of your values and goals are and now you're biting your nails to make it through the day and stay alive.** Or that root sense of not being fast enough, not having enough time, beating yourself up each time you don't stick to your plan? **I feel ya my friend and I got your back. **I have plenty moemnts to share, things to discuss and get this conversation going by handling you all that worked for me and others I know and walk together even to a greater and greater level of high performacne, peace, joy and limitless creative solutions we are born here to express and have. First of all let me introduce myself. I am Karolina, creative girl as far I remember, always mostly in a visual way. I was born in a family surrounded with flowers, compossitions, films and photography, not even mentioning all the different creaitve projects I took and created since I was even in the 1st grade. If I'd need to sum up my character - I would choose the word to create. I'm the strong catalyst, personality type, where passion and innovation blooms everywhere I go and that is why I decided to create this conversation. Although I took more focused path of 3D design, creating waterydesign solutions and showing up for creative muscle, which is showing up daily for creative actions. I always felt passionate to share the messages I felt so deeply inspired by and habits and tools I achieved through many years of development, that could help and inspire live the fulfilled life.
