            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>005: How to kill the Self-Doubt | Divinely Creative</h1><p>Self-doubt gives no further direction. You just stop or go on a roller coaster not knowing or having control over where it leads you to. That is no fun, unless you're in a circus. It gives only headaches. So how we can get off those trails and build our own?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6f699945f8f46d818eb02e1a70bdd01f1fea489a.png"></article>]]></description>
